HW1: We implemented two algorithms for Matrix Factorization regression model - SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and ALS (Alternating Least Squares).

HW2: We implemented SGD algorithm for a BPR model (Bayesian Personalised Ranking) using negative sampling and the measures Hit-Rate @k and MPR (Mean Percentile Ranking) for evaluation.
